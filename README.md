# Portfolio-Enhancing-A-Sectoral-Approach

# Introduction
Welcome to our research project on portfolio enhancement using a sectoral approach. This project was undertaken as part of our Master's program in Statistics and Data Science at SVKMâ€™s NMIMS. Our aim is to simplify stock market investment for individuals in India by introducing a structured and data-driven strategy that maximizes returns and manages risks effectively.

# Project Overview
Objective
Investing in the stock market comes with inherent risks. Our project aims to mitigate these risks by diversifying investments across various sectors. By analyzing 10 years of financial data from 500 large cap companies, we employ statistical models to optimize asset allocation, thereby enhancing portfolio returns while minimizing risks.

# Scope
Data Collection: Web-scraped from Yahoo Finance using Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and yfinance.
Data Preparation: Cleaned and processed data of 389 companies listed in the Indian stock market for 10 years.
Sector Classification: Companies classified into 11 sectors for a sectoral analysis.

# Methodology
Statistical Models Used

Mean-Variance Model (MV):
Proposed by Harry Markowitz, this model helps in generating portfolios with maximum return for a specified risk or minimum risk for a specified return.

Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR):
This measure helps in managing and mitigating the risk by focusing on the tail risk of the portfolio.

Monte Carlo Simulation:
Used for estimating the probability distributions of future returns and optimizing the portfolio with a focus on risk management.

# Techniques
Discrete Allocation:
Ensures well-diversified portfolios across different sectors to reduce risk.

Portfolio Rebalancing:
Adjusts the portfolio annually to maintain the desired risk-return balance despite market fluctuations.

# Results and Discussion
Our project demonstrates that using a sectoral approach to portfolio management not only simplifies the investment process but also significantly improves returns and manages risks. By comparing different models, we identify the optimal strategy for diverse and balanced portfolios.

# Conclusion
This project emphasizes the importance of a structured, data-driven approach to stock market investments. By leveraging statistical models and techniques, investors can make informed decisions, leading to better financial outcomes.
